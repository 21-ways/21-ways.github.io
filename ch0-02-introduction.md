*Bitcoin is different things to different people.* The first time I\'ve
heard this sentence, I immediately realized its profound truth. How you
look at Bitcoin - and how you understand and describe it - depends
largely on your view of the world. It depends on your level of
understanding of numerous subjects: economics, money, technology, game
theory, distributed systems, cryptography, physics, mathematics, even
biology. But your educational background isn\'t the only variable. Your
upbringing, your ideology, even your political views - all these will
influence how you see and understand Bitcoin.

To some, Bitcoin is a once-in-a-millennium invention\[Footnote: Some
people argue that Bitcoin can also be understood as a discovery, but
more on that later.\]: the greatest thing that happened to money since
we started picking up yellow rocks thousands of years ago. To others, it
is the greatest Ponzi scheme on earth: funny internet money that has no
intrinsic value. To me, it is one of the most fascinating phenomena of
our time. I see it as a combination of technology, monetary invention,
computer network, social movement, silent revolution, and so much more.
A piece of machinery that is both simple and extremely complex at the
same time. A living, breathing, cybernetic organism that is more than
its parts. 

I\'m convinced that Bitcoin will touch all of our lives at some point in
the future, just like electricity did in the past and the internet does
today. Most people are still unaware of this possibility, which is, at
least in part, why I am writing this book. I hope that looking at
Bitcoin from many different perspectives - explaining bits and pieces as
we go along - will help some people to make sense of this strange thing.
If you\'re thinking: *\"I still don\'t get Bitcoin,\"* then this book
might be for you.

*\"What is Bitcoin?\"* is the natural question to ask. Hundreds of
thousands, probably millions of people, have asked themselves this exact
question in the last couple of years. I was one of these people, and I
still ask myself this question periodically.

I\'m afraid there isn\'t a short and simple answer. Many smart people
have tried to give one- or two-sentence explanations, but they all fall
short in one way or another. They have to. The phenomenon in question is
too big, too multi-faceted, and too nuanced to be condensed in a short
paragraph or tweet. What these bite-sized explanations can do, however,
is draw a sketch of the many ways that Bitcoin can be described and
understood. Thus, let\'s consider some of the most memorable ones,
starting with two that are both creative and cheeky:

> Imagine if keeping your car idling 24/7 produced solved Sudokus you
> could trade for heroin.
>
> <cite>[Theophite]</cite>

> \[Bitcoin is\] Math beanie babies that live in your computer created
> by your computer playing Numberwang with other computers to vote on
> which very giant excel spreadsheet we all have a copy of is correct.
>
> <cite>[Eevee]</cite>

What\'s amusing about these answers is how much truth they contain while
also being absurd. Yes, you can trade bitcoin for heroin - if you
couldn\'t, it wouldn\'t be good money. Yes, computers are kind of
playing Numberwang with other computers, and yes, it is a little bit
like having a giant spreadsheet on all of these computers. However,
there is much more depth to Bitcoin than those answers would imply.
Also: no, computers involved in Bitcoin are not idle - they do useful
work. And no, bitcoin isn\'t \"math beanie babies\" - it\'s not just
math, and unlike beanie babies, no company is behind it.

Now let\'s take a look at some of the more earnest attempts. Here is
what serious people have to say when trying to answer \"What is
Bitcoin?\" in a bite-sized way:

> Bitcoin can be best understood as distributed software that allows for
> transfer of value using a currency protected from unexpected inflation
> without relying on trusted third parties.
>
> <cite>[Saifedean Ammous]</cite>

> \[Bitcoin is\] a global, neutral payment network that allows anyone on
> earth to transact a huge or tiny amount of value with anyone else within
> minutes, without needing to ask permission from a government, without
> disclosing one\'s personal information, and without the possibility of
> censorship.
>
> <cite>[Alex Gladstein]</cite>

> Bitcoin is global, open, borderless, freedom money.
>
> <cite>[Yan Pritzker]</cite>

Saifedean Ammous, economist and author of *The Bitcoin Standard*,
focuses on the economic aspect of unexpected inflation - and rightly so.
It is difficult to say what properties of Bitcoin are essential since
everything in Bitcoin is interwoven and not easily separable. However,
protecting the system from unexpected inflation is undoubtedly one of
the most important aspects. The strictly limited supply is an integral
part of Bitcoin\'s soul. 21 million. Not a single coin more. This
absolute scarcity is not only what lures most people in, but the promise
of an unchanging monetary policy is what gives the system its integrity.

Alex Gladstein, Chief Strategy Officer of the Human Rights Foundation,
focuses on the open and permissionless nature of Bitcoin. In a world
where governments and corporations have immense power over the financial
dealings of individuals, he is right to highlight these issues.
Resistance to censorship might not be important to you, but for
political dissidents, journalists, reporters, oppressed minorities, and
people living under authoritarian rule, access to reliable and
censorship-resistant money is essential. 

Yan Pritzker, the author of Inventing Bitcoin and co-founder & CTO of
Swan Bitcoin, combines many important properties of Bitcoin in his
short, single-sentence answer. Like the internet, Bitcoin is global in
nature. Yan also highlights the freedom-enabling aspect of this
technology by calling Bitcoin *freedom money*. Not only are you free to
use Bitcoin as you see fit, but Bitcoin ensures certain freedoms at the
base layer of the protocol. Everyone is free to join the network, send
and receive payments, store value, create accounts, audit the supply,
participate in the mining process, and so much more. These freedoms are
guaranteed through the nature of the system and will be guaranteed for
as long as Bitcoin exists. I can say that with confidence because w*hat
Bitcoin is* is a personal matter. If these freedoms disappeared, it
wouldn\'t be Bitcoin anymore, at least not to me.

Before we dive deeper, let me quote two other gentlemen. I consider them
friends, even though we\'ve never met. (Bitcoin is weird like that.)
Note, however, that I also consider them to be serious people, just like
the authors, professors, and C-level executives above. The fact that I
don\'t know their real identities doesn\'t diminish their contributions
and insights. Bitcoin had a pseudonymous creator, so I think it is
fitting that the Bitcoin space has an army of pseudonymous users,
creatives, authors, and programmers. Here is what these two have to say
about what Bitcoin is:

> Bitcoin is the people\'s money.
>
> <cite>[Bitgeiniog]</cite>

> Bitcoin is like early electricity. Raw, dangerous, seems very volatile
> and hard to use. With time it\'ll start to feel safer, easier, and
> normal. Like electricity, it will inspire and power new unimaginable
> industries. And one day we\'ll wonder: how did we live without it?
>
> <cite>[Obi-Wan Kenobit]</cite>

Money for the people, by the people. Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer
electronic cash system, as Satoshi Nakamoto explained in the title of
the Bitcoin whitepaper. Bitcoin already feels safer, easier, and more
normal to some. I hope that after reading this book, it will also feel
safer, easier, and more normal to you.

At last, let me share with you another quote I [stumbled upon] while
digging through all the material that I have saved over the years:
\"Bitcoin is too rich in properties. It would be a waste to have the
same pitch for different people.\" I wholeheartedly agree, which is why
I believe that Bitcoin cannot be well-understood by concentrating on a
single facet of it. Instead, I believe that one has to try to understand
Bitcoin holistically, which is why I will show you *[21 Ways to Look at
Bitcoin][21ways]*.
