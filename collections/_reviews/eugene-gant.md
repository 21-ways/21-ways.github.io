review: 21 Lessons is a beautiful meditation on the bitcoin discovery journey. If you find yourself suddenly gripped by the exploration of bitcoin and its implications, this book is a great compliment the more strictly factual explorations. I especially apprectiated the way Gigi normalizes the perception altering experience of falling down the bitcoin rabbit hole.
