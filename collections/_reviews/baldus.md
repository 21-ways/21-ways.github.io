review: The book is not meant to be a lengthy insight on Bitcoin, but summarizes the learning cycle of someone who starts reading about Bitcoin. The lessons are short and the message is clear. Gigi effectively managed to show that once you start reading about Bitcoin, you improve many other areas of knowledge such as economics, philosophy (freedom), besides math and programming. Highly recommended.
