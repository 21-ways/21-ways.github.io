Dear Amazon KDP,

I am the [author](https://dergigi.com/contact) of [21 Lessons](https://21lessons.com/), a book published under
a [cc-by-sa](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license. The
[English version](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1697526349/) of the book was
approved by you and is available on Amazon. The [Kindle
version](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083L93MJ7) was approved by you as well and
is available on Amazon as well.

The book was [translated into multiple
languages](https://21lessons.com/translations) by volunteers under the same
cc-by-sa license. The [German book](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B085KR54YT/) "21
Lektionen" - which was also approved by you and is available on Amazon - is
based on the two German translations which I reviewed, corrected, and modified.

The Kindle version of the German book "21 Lektionen" is equivalent to the
paperback version of "21 Lektionen" - the one you guys already approved. I am
confused about why you are unwilling to approve the Kindle version of the
already approved German book?

Sincerely, \\
[Gigi](https://dergigi.com/contact)
